# GeoGuess.it

**GeoGuess.it** is a Chrome extension built to assist players of **GeoGuessr** and other geography-based games. It captures the currently visible tab (such as a Street View scene) and uses the **meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct** model to analyze the image. The extension then suggests the top 3 most likely countries where the image could have been taken.  
Whether you're stuck on a tough round or want to sharpen your guessing skills, GeoGuess.it delivers fast, AI-powered insights to guide your next move.
